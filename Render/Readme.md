Render Readme
Most of my models were crafted from planes, I would get an upright plane, line it up with a reference image and cut out the shape using the knife tool (this was the case for the body of the M16 rifle and the bulk of the M1911 pistol) I would then extrude the plane making a 3D object with some semblence of my final model. This method, however, makes the side face of the model one large n-gon which led to some impossible faces later, to break this up I used the join tool to connect vertices and split up the n-gon, this also helped create the sharp low-poly look of the gun models. When creating all my models, except the shotgun, I used the mirror modifier in order to keep the models equal on both sides, this was incredibly useful as it meant I had to do half the work. As well as this I also sometimes made the models too high-poly, breaking the low-poly style of the rest of the model, this can be seen in the pistol grip of the M16 file in earlier versions, in order to cut these polys down I used the decimate modifier which reduces the geometry density.
